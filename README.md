# environment

This is the repository for the study of how the quenching parameters derived using [starpy](https://www.github.com/zooniverse/starpy) are correlated with the environmental properties of galaxies. 
Use of any of the materials are requested to cite Smethurst et al. (in prep).

Contact Becky Smethurst (@rjsmethurst) if you have any questions, or please submit a pull request or issue of your own!
